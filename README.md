# ODK Collect Intents Tester

This app is intended to be used for testing [ODK Collect](https://github.com/opendatakit/collect) app and presenting how to open activities of [ODK Collect](https://github.com/opendatakit/collect) directly from an external app.

[ODK Collect](https://github.com/opendatakit/collect) offers us to open a bunch of it's activities from another app. 
You can open a specific form or one of existed lists (list of empty forms, saved forms, finalized forms, sent forms).
